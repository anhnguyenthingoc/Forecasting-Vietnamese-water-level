Vietnamese water level 

The water level data was measured at several measuring stations in northern Vietnam.

The data collection period is the rainy seasons from 2015 to 2018. The rainy season starts in mid-June and ends in mid-September.

The data is taken every 2 hours, and is taken continuously throughout the rainy season of the year.

Data is used for paper: "Prediction of Water Level Using Time Series, Wavelet and Neural Network Approaches"

Abstract: 


To control water resources in many domains such as agriculture, flood forecasting, and hydro-electrical dams, forecasting water level needs to predict. In this article, a new computational approach using a data driven model and time series is proposed to calculate the forecast water level in short time. Concretely, wavelet-artificial neural network (WAANN) and time series (TS) are combined together called WAANN-TS that encourages the advantage of each model. For this real time project work, Yen Bai station, Northwest Vietnam was chosen as an experimental case study to apply the proposed model. Input variables into the Wavelet-ANN structure is water level data. Time series and ANN models are built, and their performances are compared. The results indicate the greater accuracy of the proposed models at Hanoi station. The final proposal WAANN−TS for water level forecasting shows good performance with root mean square error (RMSE) from 10−10 to 10−11.
